# Predictive-Modelling-HDB-Resale-Punggol-2023
Predictive Modelling for HDB Resale Prices

In this project, my team and I utilised Lasso, Best Reg Subset Selection, Random Forests and Bagging to find models that will minimise MSE error, along with improving the prediction of resale prices in Punggol given the independant variables in the dataset. Our group narrowed down our search and found that the Random Forest model was the best predicitve model. Read the PDF to gain more insights and thought process for each step. We got an A+ for this project and it was the best in the cohort. I unfortuantely can't find the dataset :(.
